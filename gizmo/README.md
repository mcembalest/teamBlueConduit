Gizmo
=====

A utility library for machine learning at BlueConduit.

## Getting Started

Currently, this is a simply python project. It guarantees no specific version,
and simply provides a `requirements.txt`.

This repository can be installed as a project by running `pip install -e .` in
this directory. This will install the python project in the current environment,
allowing you to `import gizmo` in any script run in that python environment.
