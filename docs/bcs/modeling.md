# Modeling

## Blue Conduit Baseline

To fit the Blue Conduit baseline XGBoost models, we can run the following command. This requires the directory structure above, in particular having run or downloaded the `predictions` directory.

- Navigate to `blue_conduit_spatial/modeling`
- Execute `python blue_conduit_baseline.py`

Taken together, these commands will generate the `pred_probs_train.npz` and `pred_probs_test.npz` files. These correspond exactly to the indices described in `train_index.npz` and `test_index.npz`.
